# docker-ffmpeg
Docker image containing ffmpeg and Python for mass-converting videos

## Note for running on UnRAID

In the extra parameters tab, you may need to add the following:

```
-it --user 99:100
```

And the following to the optional parameters:

```
bash
```

The `-it` flag allows `bash` to run indefinitely, which means the container will stay up even if you exit out of an `docker exec` session. The `--user 99:100` flag is required if you want proper permissions set on the files generated by the container.
